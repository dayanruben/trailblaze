/**
 * Pure derivation of the device coverage a unified trail declares — "what devices does this trail
 * carry direction for" — read from the trail's own content rather than its filename.
 *
 * A unified trail lives in a single file (canonically `trail.yaml`), so the filename no longer
 * encodes a classifier the way a legacy per-device `<classifier>.trail.yaml` does. The coverage is
 * instead the union of every classifier the file declares:
 *  - the keys of the optional `config.devices` run matrix, and
 *  - every classifier keying a `recording:` block on the trailhead or any step.
 *
 * These two sources can legitimately disagree: `config.devices` is the *declared run matrix* and may
 * omit a family that still carries recordings (e.g. a trail can omit iOS from `config.devices` while
 * every step still records an `ios:` block), and recordings mix broad (`android`, `ios`) and
 * device-specific (`android-tablet`, `ios-iphone`) keys within one file. We keep every declared key
 * verbatim so the coverage is faithful to what's authored, and prefer "a recording exists" over
 * "declared in `config.devices`" — a family with recordings is covered whether or not the run matrix
 * lists it.
 *
 * Shared source of truth: [xyz.block.trailblaze.devices.TrailDeviceSelector.supportedPlatformsForTrail]
 * folds these classifiers up to platforms for device selection, and the desktop Trails browser uses
 * the same union to display a unified trail's targets.
