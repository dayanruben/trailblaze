/**
 * `trailblaze app start` — start the daemon without opening Trail Runner.
 *
 * The rest of the codebase (docs, KDoc, and the `is the daemon running?` recovery hints in
 * [reportDaemonUnreachable]) spells daemon startup `app start`, and the daemon auto-start spawns
 * `app start --foreground --headless`. `--headless` and `--foreground` are re-declared here so
 * they work on either side of the verb — `app --foreground start` and `app start --foreground`
 * are equivalent. `--headless` is accepted for that spawn line and changes nothing: `start`
 * never opens a window.
 *
 * **`hidden` is load-bearing, not cosmetic — do not un-hide it.** `trailblaze
 * --describe-commands` ([describeCommands]) publishes the picocli tree for wrapper CLIs to build
 * their own command tree from. A wrapper that does so — and caches the result — can treat any
 * command with visible children as a *group*, and answer a group invoked with flags but no
 * subcommand token using its own usage text and exit 0, never reaching the JVM. An installed
 * CLI's `trailblaze` on PATH may well be such a wrapper, so the moment this subcommand became
 * visible, every flags-only `trailblaze app …` form — `--headless`, `--stop`, `--status` —
 * started answering with wrapper usage instead of doing anything, and daemon auto-start
 * silently spawned a child that wrote that usage text to `daemon.log` and died. Hiding the
 * subcommand keeps `app` a leaf in the published tree while leaving `app start` fully parseable
 * here.
