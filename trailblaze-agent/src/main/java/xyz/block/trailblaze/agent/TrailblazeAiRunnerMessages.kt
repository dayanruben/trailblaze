        ## ACTION REQUIRED: REPORT TASK STATUS
        
        You just performed an action using a tool.
        You MUST now report the status of the current objective item by calling the objectiveStatus tool with one of the following statuses:
        - status="in_progress" if you're still working on this specific objective item and need to take more actions
        - status="completed" if you've fully accomplished all instructions in the current objective.
        - status="failed" if this specific objective item cannot be completed after multiple attempts.
        
        Include a detailed message explaining what you just did and your assessment of the situation.
        
        IMPORTANT: You CANNOT perform any other action until you report progress using objectiveStatus.
        Carefully assess if the action you just took completely fulfilled this specific objective item before deciding the status.
        
        ## CURRENT TASK
        
        Current objective item to focus on is:

        After you complete this objective item, call the objectiveStatus tool IMMEDIATELY.
        DO NOT proceed to the next objective item until this one is complete and you've called objectiveStatus.
