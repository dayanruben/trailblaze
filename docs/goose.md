Note: Trailblaze can work with any MCP client, we've just optimized for Goose.

- Download the Goose Desktop app to run Trailblaze. [Installation Guide](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation/) to set it up.
- Configure your LLM API Keys to use Goose [LLM Provider Configuration](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/providers).

## 2. Run Trailblaze
